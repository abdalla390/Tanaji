# Tanaji
Tanaji is an open-source project dedicated to developing AI-powered applications that assist Muslims in reciting, memorizing, and studying the Quran. 
It uses Tarteel AI Quran data base to train a foundational model to instead of fine-tuning a model (the way Tarteel did it)


The main dataset we use is https://huggingface.co/datasets/tarteel-ai/EA-DI made by the lovely folks over at Tarteel AI. 

This is a quick project we are tackling as students to further our knowledge in Machine Learning and also make a good faithed project that has the potential to help many people along the way.
